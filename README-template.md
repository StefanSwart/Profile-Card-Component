### The challenge

- Build out the project to the designs provided

### Links

- Live Site URL: (https://stefanswart.github.io/Profile-Card-Component/)

## My process

- First I did the html markup and then completed the css. I went back and forth between html and css as I figured things out.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I ran into the problem of my card changing sizes so i hard coded the height and width in px, instead of using vh and vw.

### Continued development

I'm still working on a uDemy course (The Web Developer Bootcamp 2021 by Colt Steele). I also plan to do more frontend mentor challenges and using mdn to do research as I work.

### Useful resources

- (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me reseach css properties and how to use them.
